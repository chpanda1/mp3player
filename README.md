# mp3player
I created this music player so my instructor would understand my knowledge on html, css, and javascript.

This is a simple music player with only 3 music the functions are next track, previous track, play, pause, and volume volume.
everytime the music change the background color randomly change, the image also change base on what music is playing.
The playlist is static and its stored in an array of objects.

I am sorry if my design is bad I am not that creative.

I wanted to make the playlist dynamic using api but I dont have a lot of time
